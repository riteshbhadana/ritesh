export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hello! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (BTech) in 
        Computer Science with a specialization in 
        Artificial Intelligence from 
        GURUGRAM UNIVERSITY, Gurugram. Coding is my passion, 
       and I thrive on the challenges that come with solving new problems. I enjoy taking on 
       new coding challenges and continuously pushing my boundaries.
       I primarily code in C++ and Python. 
       I use C++ for solving 
      Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems on platforms 
       like LeetCode.Python, on the other 
       hand, is my preferred language for Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects. 
       I leverage Python for all subsets of AI, 
       constantly exploring new technologies and tools in the field.
       I am always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest advancements in technology. Currently, 
       I am actively seeking internship opportunities as a 
      Backend Developer and AI & ML Engineer, where I can apply my 
       skills and contribute to innovative projects.`
